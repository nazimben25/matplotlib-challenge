Challenge 5, matplotlib


Output for challenge module 5 (matplotlib) - UoT

2 source files (csv) are in /Resources folder

The code must be runned in "challeng5mywork.ipynb"

The code is runned accordingly to the 
    - instructions given
    - the jupiter file PyCitySchools_starter and its markdowns (still attached in the repositry)

I tried to give detailed clarifications and comments inside the code

NOTE : 
    - steps of : calculation of the outliers and generate boxplot
        - i propose a dynamic cod that allows us to use the list of the treatments we want to compare
        this list can be changed (replace a treatments, add or remove treatments), the code will adapt

    - step of the line plot for 1 single mouse
        - the mouse is selected randomly among the mouses that had the chooses treatment. i did not filter specifically the mouse I509 as in the example of the STARTER jupyter file

The code is fragile : please use with lot of care !
